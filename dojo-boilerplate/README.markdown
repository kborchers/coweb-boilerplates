#Coweb + Dojo Boilerplate

##About

This boilerplate is a working, generic, AMD-formatted web application that has
the OpenCoweb and Dojo frameworks already configured and working. It is meant to
serve as a starting point for any future applications developed for the
OpenCoweb framework using Dojo 1.8 AMD so that minimal or no setup is required.

##Quick Start

1. If you haven't already, follow
[these instructions](http://opencoweb.org/ocwdocs/tutorial/install.html) to
deploy a Coweb instance.
2. Clone repository:

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:opencoweb/coweb-boilerplates
```
3. Start a coweb server instance.
4. Visit the app in your browser.

##Deploying

See the [tutorial](http://opencoweb.org/ocwdocs/tutorial/install.html) for more
information on installing and running these boilerplates.

##A Brief Tour

The structure of this directory is extremely straight forward. The following
files are all you need to worry about when developing:

* ```index.html``` : serves as the main html file of the application
* ```application.js``` : serves as the main javascript file of the application
* ```application.css``` : serves as the main CSS of the application
* ```main.js``` : serves as the bootstrap file for the application, configures globals
